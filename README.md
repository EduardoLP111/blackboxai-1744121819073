   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Depending on your project structure, you may want to install dependencies for both the frontend and backend. Use the commands below to install the required packages.

   For the backend (assuming Node.js is being used):
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

   For the frontend, make sure to include scripts for any frontend package manager you might be using (like npm or yarn).

3. **Configure the application:**
   Ensure to set up any necessary configuration files located in the `config/` directory. Modify `database.js` and `serverConfig.js` as needed to match your environment settings.

4. **Run the application:**
   Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

   Open `frontend/index.html` in a web browser to view the application interface.
